# Naturize
Naturize : Extended is a datapack for Minecraft. It adds some gameplay mecanismes (low gravity physics, realistic nature, quicksands, armors sets, combat skills...), particules (some cool visual effects, bleedings, choc waves). The goal is to add some "role play" of the game, changing few mecanismes for a better immersion.

# Requires 
- Minecraft 1.14+
- Pretty Strong PC/Server
- Bug tolerance

# Use
1. Download the package and unzip it
2. Copy/paste the entire "Naturize-Extended-[branch_name]/" folder in your "saves/your-map/datapacks/" folder.
3. Launch the game/server and play your map (you have an ingame message to confirm datapack's installation/update).

Option 1 : adjust the datapack properties to your needs modifying the "data\naturize\functions\properties.mcfunction" file
Option 2 : adjust bundles properties to your needs modifying the "data\naturize\functions\bundles\[bundle_name]\properties.mcfunction" file
